## Setting Up Your Loom Docs
Learn how to update your Loom documentation locally and deploy it for everyone to see.

### Edit and Preview
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone Your Docs Locally" icon="github">
    We've set up a dedicated GitHub repository for your Loom documentation during the onboarding process. You can easily find this repository on your [Loom dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To get a copy of the documentation files on your local machine, simply follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview Your Changes" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Previewing your changes is crucial to ensure everything looks perfect before going live. We've integrated a command-line interface to help you render these changes locally.

    1.  **Install the Mintlify CLI** to preview your documentation changes locally. Run this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2.  Navigate to the root of your Loom documentation folder (where `docs.json` is located) and run: `mintlify dev`

    <Note>
      If you're currently using the older `mint.json` configuration file, please update your Mintlify CLI to the latest version:

      `npm i -g mintlify@latest`
      Then, run the upgrade command within your docs repository:

      `mintlify upgrade`
      You should now be using the new `docs.json` configuration file. Feel free to delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.
    </Note>

### Deploy Your Changes
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install Our GitHub App" icon="message-bot">
    Our custom GitHub app streamlines the deployment process for your Loom docs. It automatically deploys your changes, so you don't have to worry about manual updates. You'll find the installation link on your [Loom dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once successfully installed, you'll see a checkmark next to the commit hash in your repository, confirming the bot is active.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push Your Changes" icon="rocket">
    Once you're happy with your updates, [commit and push your changes to Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push). This will update your live Loom documentation site. If for any reason you push changes and don't see the GitHub app successfully deploying them, you can always manually update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
