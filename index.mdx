## Setting Up Loom on Your Discord Server

This guide will show you how to get Loom started on your Discord server.

### Getting Loom Ready

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invite Loom to Your Server" icon="discord">
    The first step is to **invite Loom to your Discord server**. You can usually find an "Invite" link on the Loom website or dashboard. Click this link and follow the steps to give Loom the necessary permissions to work on your server. Make sure to choose the correct server!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Give Loom Permissions (If Needed)" icon="shield-check">
    After inviting, Loom might need specific permissions to do its job, like sending messages or managing roles. Your server administrator can adjust these permissions in your Discord server settings under **"Server Settings" > "Roles"**. Look for Loom in the list of roles and make sure it has the permissions it needs to function correctly.

  <Card title="Get Help" icon="question">
    If you ever get stuck or have questions about Loom, there's usually a support server or a help command (`/help`) that can guide you. Don't hesitate to ask for assistance!
