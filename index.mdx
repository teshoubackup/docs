## Setting Up Loom on Your Discord Server: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to bring Loom to your Discord server and start using its features right away. It's designed for everyone, no technical experience needed!

### Bringing Loom Aboard

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Invite Loom to Your Server" icon="discord">
    The very first thing you need to do is **invite Loom to your Discord server**. This is usually done by clicking a special "Invite" link, which you can typically find on Loom's official website or within its dashboard.

    Once you click the link, Discord will ask you to choose which of your servers you want Loom to join. Make sure you select the **correct server** from the list! You'll also be prompted to grant Loom certain basic permissions. It's important to allow these so Loom can function properly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2: Check Loom's Permissions (If Needed)" icon="shield-check">
    After inviting Loom, your server might already be good to go. However, sometimes Loom might need specific permissions to do certain tasks, like sending messages in specific channels or managing roles for its features.

    If Loom isn't working as expected, a **server administrator** can easily adjust these permissions. Here's how:
    1.  Go to your Discord server's settings. You can usually find this by clicking on your **server's name** at the top left and then selecting **"Server Settings"**.
    2.  In Server Settings, navigate to the **"Roles"** section.
    3.  Look for **Loom** in the list of roles. Click on it.
    4.  Here, you can review and enable any necessary permissions that Loom might require to fully operate. Make sure it has what it needs!

  <Card title="Discover Loom's Commands" icon="book-open">
    Loom works using **commands**, which are special instructions you type into Discord. Most Loom commands start with a **`/` (slash)**. For instance, typing `/help` and pressing Enter will likely show you a list of all the commands Loom knows.

    To get the most out of Loom, it's a great idea to check out Loom's official documentation or support channels for a **full list of its commands** and what they do. This will help you unlock all of Loom's potential!

  <Card title="Set Up Dedicated Channels" icon="hash">
    To keep your Discord server organized and clean, you might want to create **specific channels** where Loom can send its messages or where members can use Loom's commands.

    For example, you could create:
    * A **`#loom-commands`** channel where members can type Loom's commands without cluttering other chats.
    * A **`#loom-updates`** channel where Loom posts automated messages or important information.
    This helps keep your server tidy and makes it easier for everyone to interact with Loom.

    * Look for Loom's **official support server** on Discord. This is a great place to ask questions directly and get help from the Loom community or developers.
